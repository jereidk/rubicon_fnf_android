## Frame rate cap. Not a graphics setting in the usual sense - it does
## nothing for image quality - but on a device that cannot hold 60 it is
## worth more than any of the above. Chimera on a moto g53 oscillates
## between 60fps and sub-20 with spikes past 140ms, and that swing is what
## reads as stuttering; a phone locked to a rate it can actually sustain
## feels smooth at half the numbers. 0 means uncapped.

## Only Very Low sets this - strips every decorative/post-processing shader
## effect in the project (see LullabySettings.EFFECT_SHADER_PATHS) while
## leaving shaders that are a node's actual base material untouched (e.g.
## the shop console's toon shading, the cartridge dissolve-in animation).
